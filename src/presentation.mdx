## But first, let's talk about **JavaScript Fatigue**

---


### There was a time when there was a new JavaScript library every day

---

<Center>
  <Tweet id="1188271195671744513" />
</Center>

---

## Developers like to **reinvent the wheel** constantly

---

## React

- Class Components, Function Components
- Mixins, High order components, Render props, hooks
- CSS, SCSS, CSS-in-JS
- Flux, Redux, Redux-Sagas, MobX, Context
- Suspense

## This does not happen only in React

*(I can wait to start using the Composition Api in Vue and remove all the mixins)*

---

## Be updated on the JavaScript community can be **frustrating**

---

## Can we see the JavaScript Fatigue with a **positive perspective**?

---

# Innovation

---

### Types of improvements

- **User facing** improvements
- **Developer experience** improvements

---

## **Nobody** is going to say that your application is awesome because you are using React

---

### We need to deal with **FOMO** (Fear Of Missing Out)

---

## Hey Axel, why are you talking about this? I came here to listen about Deno

---

## I want you to have a **positive perspective** of the JavaScript Fatigue

*(at least during this talk)*

---

## I know **this talk** can produce some JavaScript Fatigue

---

## Deno is the **first real competitor** of Node

---

#### About the talk title...

## Node is Dead, Long Live Deno

---

## Sorry, that title was pure **clickbait**

---

## Don't worry, **Node is not dead**

- Node is not going anywhere
- Deno is not production ready yet
- Deno does not have a stable version yet

---

## Deno is a **secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript**

---

## The man behind Deno: **Ryan Dhal**

- Creator of Node in 2009
- Left Node in 2012

---

## JavaScript has **changed a lot** since Node creation

---

## Promises and async/await

---

## Sadly, callbacks are still a thing

---

<Center>

## Things are improving

```
// Since Node 10
const fs = require('fs').promises;
```

</Center>

---


<Center>

## But they are not perfect yet

```
const util = require('util');
const exec = util.promisify(require('child_process').exec);

async function lsExample() {
  const { stdout, stderr } = await exec('ls');
  console.log('stdout:', stdout);
  console.error('stderr:', stderr);
}
lsExample();
```

</Center>

---

<Center>

## in Deno every async API use Promises

```
const p = Deno.run({ args: ["echo", "hello"] });
await p.status(); // await its completion
```

</Center>

---

## Module System

- ES Modules didn't exist when Node was designed
- They created CommonJS

---

<Center>

#### ES Modules in Node is taking a long time

---

## Deno **Module System**

---

<Center>

## Imports can be relative or urls

```
import { awesomeFunction } from "./awesomeLib.js";
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";
```

</Center>

---

## When importing from a URL

- Deno will download the file and store it in a local cache
- Next time the program is executed it will use the cache version
- You can use a flag `--reload` to have a fresh copy of the dependency

---

## This looks like a small change, but it has a **lot of implications**

- No more `package.json` to declare the dependencies
- Simplify the whole resolution algorithm
- We are **not forced to use NPM anymore**, we can publish our code in our own servers

---

### What is the relationship between Node and NPM?

---

## NPM is a **private company** that has the **control over the public registry**

---

## From time to time companies remind us that their **main goal is to earn money**

## CJ Silverio: The Economics of Package Management

- **Open source generates** a lot of value
- Most of us give away source code not expecting money
- Our common registry of shared code is owned by a private company
- Packages cost money even if you are not paying for them
- NPM is obligated to its owners not us

## Deno Module System is an elegant solution to the centralization problem

```
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";

// it is very similar to how the web works

<script src="https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts"></script>
```

</Center>

---

## TypeScript

- Deno includes TypeScript support out of the box
- TypeScript is awesome
  - I don't like guessing object shapes
  - It gives your editor superpowers
- Deno binary includes the TypeScript compiler
- Deno core is writen is TypeScript

---

<Center>

### You can import ts dependencies without transpile

```
import { pad } from "https://deno.land/std/strings/pad.ts";

pad("deno", 6, { char: "*", side: "left" });
```

</Center>

---

## Security

- V8 is a **secure sandbox**
- Node doesn't use those security capabilities

---

## event-stream vulnerability

- `event-stream` is a popular package created by `dominictarr`.
- He doesn't have time to maintain the package
- `dominictarr` gave `right9ctrl` access on GitHub and npm
- `right9ctrl` pushed some regular commits
- `right9ctrl` added a dependency `flatmap-stream`, published a version to npm, and then removed the dependency
- The dependency was designed to tried to steal bitconins wallet

<Reference href="https://schneider.dev/blog/event-stream-vulnerability-explained">
  event-stream vulnerability explained
</Reference>

---

## Deno security

- By default script run without any network or file system access
- Deno will prompt the user for access
- Users can opt in via flags

---

<Center>

### Deno security flags

```
--allow-env
--allow-net
--allow-read
--allow-write
--allow-run
```

</Center>

---

<Center>

### Deno security flags

```
deno --allow-read=/tmp script1.ts
deno --allow-net=google.com script2.ts
```

</Center>

---

## STD Library

- Node has a very small core
- This can lead to to micropackages
- Many libraries implement the same functionality

---

---

## Deno Standard Modules (deno_std)

- Deno has a std library
- Versioned with the binary, but not included

```
import { v4 } from "https://deno.land/std/uuid/mod.ts"
const uuid = v4();
```

---

## Deno std

<Split>
<div>

- colors
- datetime
- examples
- flags
- fs
- http
- log

</div>
<div>

- media_types
- prettier
- strings
- testing
- toml
- ws
- ...

</div>
</Split>

<Reference href="https://deno.land/std/">deno_std</Reference>

---

<Center>

## Deno full toolset

```
deno fmt (format files, using prettier)
deno test (run tests)
deno install (similar npm install --global)
deno bundle (generate a single .js including all dependencies)
deno eval (eval a script)
deno xeval (eval a script based on text segments from stdin)
x deno compile (build a single binary distributable)
x deno lint
```

</Center>

---

## Browser compatibility

- Deno tries to be compatible with the browser where is possible
- e.g. Deno uses `window` as global variable instead of Node's `global`.

```
> window
{ Deno, queueMicrotask, window, atob, btoa, fetch, clearTimeout,
 clearInterval, setTimeout, setInterval, location, onload, onunload, crypto,
 Blob, File, CustomEvent, Event, EventTarget, URL, URLSearchParams, ...
```

# Try it now

```
brew install deno
deno eval "console.log('hello world')"
```

---

## Conclusion

- Deno has some interesting features
- Should I start using Deno right now? Only if you want to experiment with something new
- Node is not going anywhere anytime soon
